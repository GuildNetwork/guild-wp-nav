Add Guild navigation widgets to use on your site that will increase engagement and pageviews per session.

== Description ==

The Guild navigation widgets allow you to add modern stunning navigation controls to the pages on your site.

Instead of a simple list of recommended pages to visit next, these widgets give the viewer a rich interactive experience and the ability to visualize your entire site within a widget.

This is combined with our data analytics capability that uses information on your site as well as your analytics data to direct visitors toward the content that is more likely to be interesting to them, taking into account where they have already been on your site.

This plugin works in combination with the Guild service.  We monitor your site and analytics so that the navigation is always fresh.

== Installation ==

1. Visit [https://guild.network](https://guild.network) and preview the widget.
2. Enter the URL and enable analytics so that you can see what it will look like on your own site.
3. Copy your unique alphanumeric site code which you will need in the next step.
4. Install and activate this plugin.
5. Go to its Settings page and save the site code to complete the activation.
6. You will now find Guild Navigator among the list of available widgets.
7. Update your site design using the widget wherever you want.
8. Review your updated site and enjoy!
